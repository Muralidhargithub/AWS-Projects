# Respiratory Virus ED Visits Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV. The analysis leverages SQL for data manipulation and Python for data visualization to provide critical insights into public health trends, resource allocation, and policy-making.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2023-respiratory-virus-response-nssp-emergency-department-visit-trajectories-by-state-covi). It includes ED visit data for COVID-19, Influenza, RSV, and combined respiratory pathogens by state, along with trends and additional demographic and environmental data.

## Case Study

### Objective

The objective of this case study is to analyze ED visits for respiratory pathogens to identify trends, correlations, and insights that can inform public health strategies. By examining various factors such as geographic distribution, demographic impacts, environmental influences, and behavioral patterns, we aim to uncover valuable information that can help in better resource allocation and policy-making.

### Analysis Approach

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Enhanced the dataset by adding columns for demographic data, environmental factors, behavioral insights, and economic impact.

2. **SQL Queries**:
   - Created a new table in the SQL database and loaded the enhanced dataset.
   - Performed various analyses using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Used Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create visualizations for the extracted insights.

### Insights and Analysis

**Geographic Distribution Analysis**
- **State-wise Analysis**: Identified states with the highest and lowest average percentages of ED visits for respiratory pathogens, highlighting areas of high burden and effective control.
- **Regional Hotspots**: Pinpointed regions with consistently high or low percentages of ED visits to focus public health efforts and resources.

**Trend Classification**
- **Significant Changes and Stable Periods**: Identified periods with significant increases or decreases in ED visits for each pathogen and state to understand the temporal dynamics of respiratory illnesses.

**Correlation and Relationship Analysis**
- **Inter-pathogen Correlations**: Investigated correlations between ED visits for different pathogens to understand the relationships between various respiratory illnesses.
- **Cross-State Comparisons**: Compared trends and patterns across states to identify similarities and differences in the impact of respiratory illnesses.

**Seasonal Patterns**
- Analyzed seasonal patterns and cycles in the incidence of respiratory pathogens to anticipate future outbreaks and prepare healthcare resources.

**Demographic Analysis**
- Examined the impact of demographic factors such as age, gender, and socio-economic status on ED visits for respiratory pathogens to understand which populations are most affected.

**Healthcare Utilization and Capacity**
- Analyzed ED visit trends to provide insights into healthcare utilization and capacity, helping to identify periods of strain on the healthcare system.

**Environmental Factors**
- Integrated environmental data such as air quality, temperature, and humidity to understand their impact on respiratory illnesses.

**Behavioral Insights**
- Analyzed behavioral data such as mobility and mask compliance to understand how human behavior impacts the spread of respiratory pathogens.

**Economic Impact Analysis**
- Estimated the economic impact of increased ED visits and hospitalizations during peak periods of respiratory illness to guide policy planning and funding allocation.

**Longitudinal Analysis**
- Conducted a longitudinal analysis to understand the long-term trends and outcomes of public health interventions over multiple years.
