# Project Description
The Respiratory Virus ED Visits Analysis project aims to provide in-depth analysis and visualization of emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory pathogens such as COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV. The dataset used is related to ED visits across various states in the US, offering valuable insights into the spread and impact of these pathogens.

# Motivation for the Analysis
Monitoring ED visits for respiratory pathogens is crucial for public health officials, policymakers, and healthcare providers to:
* Assess and understand trends and patterns in respiratory illnesses.
* Allocate resources effectively and prepare for future outbreaks.
* Inform and optimize public health strategies and interventions.
* Understand the impact of demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors on the spread of respiratory illnesses.

# Data Collection and Enhancement

The dataset used in this project was collected from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2023-respiratory-virus-response-nssp-emergency-department-visit-trajectories-by-state-covi). It includes data on ED visits for COVID-19, Influenza, RSV, and combined respiratory pathogens by state, along with trends and additional demographic and environmental data.

To enhance the analysis, the dataset was augmented with additional columns:
- Month and Year
- Age group, Gender, Socio-economic status
- Air quality index, Temperature, Humidity
- Mobility index, Mask compliance
- Estimated cost of ED visits

# Analysis and Insights

The analysis was conducted using SQL for data manipulation and Python for data visualization. Key insights were derived in the following areas:

1. **Geographic Distribution Analysis**
   - **State-wise Analysis**: Identified states with the highest and lowest average percentages of ED visits for respiratory pathogens.
   - **Regional Hotspots**: Highlighted regions with consistently high or low percentages of ED visits.

2. **Trend Classification**
   - **Significant Changes and Stable Periods**: Determined periods with significant increases or decreases in ED visits for each pathogen and state.

3. **Correlation and Relationship Analysis**
   - **Inter-pathogen Correlations**: Investigated correlations between ED visits for different pathogens.
   - **Cross-State Comparisons**: Compared trends and patterns across states to identify similarities and differences.

4. **Seasonal Patterns**
   - Analyzed seasonal patterns and cycles in the incidence of respiratory pathogens.

5. **Demographic Analysis**
   - Examined the impact of demographic factors such as age, gender, and socio-economic status on ED visits.

6. **Healthcare Utilization and Capacity**
   - Analyzed ED visit trends to provide insights into healthcare utilization and capacity.

7. **Environmental Factors**
   - Integrated environmental data such as air quality, temperature, and humidity to understand their impact on respiratory illnesses.

8. **Behavioral Insights**
   - Analyzed behavioral data such as mobility and mask compliance to understand how human behavior impacts the spread of respiratory pathogens.

9. **Economic Impact Analysis**
   - Estimated the economic impact of increased ED visits and hospitalizations during peak periods of respiratory illness.

10. **Longitudinal Analysis**
    - Conducted a longitudinal analysis to understand the long-term trends and outcomes of public health interventions.
